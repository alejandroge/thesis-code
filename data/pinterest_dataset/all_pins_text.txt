One of the best survival fire-making tools is a combination of cotton balls and petroleum jelly, and you can make these firestarter kits for pennies.    Basically, you infuse (or gob) the cotton balls with Vaseline or some petroleum jelly derivative (such as Chapstick, Purell handcleaner, etc). When you need to make a fire, fluff up the cotton (as much as you can), and light it with a shower of sparks from a magnesium stick, match, or butane lighter.
Spiral Hotdogs... This is a regular for us now. I give the kids the option of spiral or octopus. They LOVE this. And everyone thinks I am the coolest for knowing how to do it.
